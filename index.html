 <h3> Marilyn Monroe
 <p> Marilyn Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortenson in Los Angeles in 1926, and brought up by Christian foster parents because her mother Gladys was <br>
  mentally unable to raise a child. She later became a ward of the state, living with allegedly abusive family friends, and then in an orphanage. <br>
  By age seven, Monroe was back in her birth mother's care, although as shown in Blonde, <br> her mother would be institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia shortly thereafter.
   Monroe spent her childhood in various orphanages and foster homes, where she allegedly faced sexual abuse and emotional distress.

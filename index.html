 <h3> Marilyn Monroe
 <p> Marilyn Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortenson in Los Angeles in 1926, and brought up by Christian foster parents because her mother Gladys was <br>
  mentally unable to raise a child. She later became a ward of the state, living with allegedly abusive family friends, and then in an orphanage. <br>
  By age seven, Monroe was back in her birth mother's care, although as shown in Blonde, <br> her mother would be institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia shortly thereafter.<br>
   Monroe spent her childhood in various orphanages and foster homes, where she allegedly faced sexual abuse and emotional distress. Years after, she became a popular <br>
  photographers model and in 1946 she signed a short-term contract with Twenieth Century Fox, taking her screen name as Marylin Monroe. After a few brief appearences <br>
  in movies made by Fox and Colombia Studios, she was again unemployed, and she returned to modeling for photographers. </p>
